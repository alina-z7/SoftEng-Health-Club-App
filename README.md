## About the App
The SoftEng Health Club is known for its commitment to member satisfaction. It aims to enhance its services with a new membership management system. As the club grows, it seeks to streamline operations and improve communication with its members. This system will help SoftEng efficiently manage memberships, handle renewals, and support better member engagement. With a focus on maintaining its reputation for excellent service. This new system will ensure both staff and members enjoy a smooth experience. The system will be designed to handle various membership durations, notify members of upcoming renewals, and allow for on-the-spot membership renewals and sign-up. Additionally, it will offer tools for the clubâ€™s management to monitor member activity and generate reports for operational decisions. The following document outlines the complete design needed to meet these objectives and ensure smooth operation for both members and staff. The SoftEng Health Club's suggested membership management system is made to specifically address the demands of both the club and its customers.  This solution will increase membership satisfaction by emphasizing automation, user experience, and data insights through specialized latent tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language for backend development.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for storing and retrieving all membership data.
- **XML**: Used for defining the GUI layouts of the application.

## Implementation Details

The SoftEng Health Club Membership Management System comprises several Java classes and interfaces, each responsible for specific functionalities that ensure robust operation and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key components:

### Database Integration:

- Utilizes MySQL for data storage, managing members' data, session logs, and authentication details.
- Connection and query executions are managed through standard JDBC API calls, ensuring reliable data transactions and security against SQL injection via prepared statements.

### User Interface:

- Designed using Java Swing, providing a native look and feel that is familiar to users.
- The login page is created with a combination of labels, text fields, and buttons laid out using a `GridLayoutManager` to ensure a responsive layout across different screen resolutions.


## Known Bugs
- **Selection Issue After Sorting**: Selecting a member after sorting the table by column selects the member that was in the row before sorting. This can lead to incorrect member actions and needs attention to ensure accurate data manipulation.
- **Array Out of Bounds Error**: An array out of bounds error occurs when the delete button is clicked without selecting a member. This error can crash the application, leading to potential data loss and reduced system stability.

## About the Team
This project is developed by a dedicated team of software engineering students from the COMP330 course. The team has embraced the challenge of developing a robust membership management system and has shown exceptional commitment to continuous improvement and clear communication.
